                <p>My name is Bill Nighy. If you are looking for a science guy, you got the wrong Bill, I am an actor!
                    My last name is also pronounced slightly different from the science guy's, but I won't go into that
                    here. I was born on December 12<sup>th</sup> 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, to Catherine Josephine Nighy
                    and Alfred Martin Nighy, and I currently reside in Pimlico, London.
                </p>
                <p>I have acting experience in many forms, from stage to cinema and TV as well as radio and voice acting
                    for video games, such as the Destiny series. Apart from acting, I am also known for my support of
                    total gender equality. The highlighting of gender inequality in my industry has influenced my choice
                    of film roles. My role in <i>Pride</i> is one of my most cherished.
                </p>
                <p> Suits are the clothes of my choice, preferrably navy colored. I was actually listed as one of the 50
                    best-dressed over-50 by <a
                        href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2013/mar/29/50-best-dressed-over-50s">The
                        Guardian</a> in March 2013, and one of <a
